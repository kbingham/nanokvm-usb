# nanokvm-usb

A USB KVM Native client for the Sipeed NanoKVM-USB device.
(https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/kvm/NanoKVM_USB/quick_start.html) without
needing to run Chrome or an electron bloated HTML application.

Conjoured up by Kieran Bingham, derived from the GPL-3 code from Sipeed as
documentation for how they are operating the USB-HID over USB Serial protocol.
